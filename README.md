# Scalable Arduino-Based LoRa Sensor Network
Uses Arduino-Uno to build a network of LoRa transceivers and associated sensors.


In an earlier effort, https://github.com/SoothingMist/Remote-Soil-Moisture-Sensing, a prototype for using LoRa radio broadcasts to remotely monitor sensors was demonstrated. Soil-moisture is the application but the approach is general enough that other sensors could be employed. Open-Access software and programming tools were used exclusively. Open-Access hardware was employed as much as possible. The basestation can be hosted locally, with no network employed, or remotely, via the internet or a local network.

At issue with the earlier effort is that it works well in situations where there are no inhibitions to the propagation of the transmitterâ€™s radio broadcasts. For instance, there may be a hill between the transmitter and the receiver. As the number of sensors expands and the number of propagation inhibitors increases, a network of transceivers would need to be formed. This would enhance the scalability of the overall system.

This present project uses ArduinoUno/Dragino microcontroller/transceiver units from the earlier effort to build a network of transceiver/sensing units in such a way that the overall system is scalable but without using formal and expensive LoRaWAN equipment. In a sense, hardware is replaced by software. To be sure, the formal LoRaWAN standard has not been implemented. However, many of its attributes are present.

This particular posting demonstrates AES encryption/decryption as signals pass from transmitter to receiver.
